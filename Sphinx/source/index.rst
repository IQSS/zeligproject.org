**Zelig** is a framework with an easy-to-use program that can estimate, help interpret, and present the results of a large range of statistical methods. It literally is "everyone's statistical software" because Zelig uses (R) code from many researchers. We also hope it will become "everyone's statistical software" for applications, and we have designed it so that anyone can use it or add their methods to it. Zelig comes with detailed, self-contained documentation that minimizes startup costs for Zelig and R (with all methods described in exactly the same notation, syntax, and style), automates graphics and summaries for all models, and, with only three simple required commands, makes the power of R accessible for all users. Zelig also works well for teaching, and is designed so that scholars can use the same program with students that they use for their research. Zelig is built on a wide ranging `ontology of statistical methods <http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/z-abs.shtml>`_.
