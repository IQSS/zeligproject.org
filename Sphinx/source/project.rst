Zelig is a common framework for statistical analyses built on the R language.  It offers a simple, unified structure that encompasses many statistical methods already implemented in R.  Zelig is an easy-to-use program that can estimate, help interpret, and present results of wide ranging statistical methods.  Zelig uses R code from many researchers, making it “everyone’s statistical software.”  We hope it becomes everyone’s statistical software for applications too, as we designed it so anyone can use it or add their methods to it.  Zelig interfaces with existing statistical packages using an intuitive model bridging call structure. Clear, detailed documentation is available that facilitates learning Zelig, with verbatim notation, syntax, and style as R.  Zelig is a powerful tool for teaching, designed so scholars can use the same programs with students that they use for their research.  With only three simple commands, Zelig makes the power of R accessible for all users.
 
Importantly, Zelig adds considerable infrastructure to improve the use of existing methods:

- Translates hard-to-interpret coefficients into meaningful quantities of interest, and the extent of uncertainty in these quantities (`Clarify <http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/clarify-software-interpreting-and-presenting-statistical-results>`_, for Stata)

- Permits easy evaluation of first differences and counterfactuals (`WhatIf <http://gking.harvard.edu/whatif>`_)

- Combines multiply imputed data sets to address missing data (`Amelia <http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/amelia-ii-program-missing-data>`_)
 
- Automates bootstrapping for all models that permit approximation of the probability distribution and parameter estimates (Bayesian simulation)

- Uses advanced nonparametric matching commands, which overcome limitations of parametric procedures (`MatchIt <http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/matchit-nonparametric-preprocessing-parametric-causal-inference>`_)

- Generates replication data files so others can replicate analysis results, contributing to the reproducibility of research (Replication Standard)

- Allows conditional population and superpopulation inferences

- Automates graphics and summaries for all models

Zelig includes many specific methods, based on likelihood, frequentist, Bayesian, robust Bayesian, and nonparametric theories of inference.  Developers can make their R packages usable from Zelig by writing a few simple bridge functions.

     **Zelig (noun) /ˈzɛlɪɡ/ :**  An entity with chameleon like characteristics, able to change appearance and form to fit appropriately in any circumstance.

     Leonard Zelig was born in Brooklyn, New York at the turn of the century into a Jewish immigrant family. He gained notoriety and celebrity status during the 1920s due to his supernatural ability to look and act like whomever was around him. F. Scott Fitzgerald penned in his memoirs of meeting Leonard Zellman, a charming and impeccably dressed aristocrat, at an affluent garden party in Long Island. Lou Zelig turned up soon after at the New York Yankees spring training camp in Florida. Later, he was seen as a member of Al Capone’s Cosa Nostra and a black jazz musician in Chicago. Leonard inspired Woody Allen’s 1983 fictionalized documentary film, Zelig, about this “chameleon man” who changed his appearance and persona to comfortably blend into his surroundings and integrate himself into important historical events.

     The Zelig framework intuitively bridges existing R models with statistical advances to yield meaningful estimates that facilitate precise data interpretation and reproducible science.  Zelig incorporates any statistical scenario, making it Everyone’s Statistical Software.
